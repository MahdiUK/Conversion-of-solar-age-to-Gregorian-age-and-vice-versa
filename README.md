In this code for getting bpth the solar year and Greorian year I only used a simple matemathic formula:
If you have your Gregorian year and want to know about your solar year, you just need to subtraction 621 of your Gregorian year.
For Example:  Your Gregorian is 1994.  ----> 1994 - 621 = 1373 <------
Note: For getting your Gregorian year, you just need to plus 621 to your solar year.
