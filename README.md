In this code for getting the solar year and Gregorian year I only used a simple mathematic formula:
If you have your Gregorian year and want to know about your solar year, you just need to subtract 621 from your Gregorian year.
For Example, Your Gregorian year is 1994.  ----> 1994 - 621 = 1373 <------
Note: For getting your Gregorian year, you have a reverce process, you just need to plus 621 to your solar year.
